# Symphony - END to END Data Science and Machine Learning Project
Symphony is a full-stack Data Science project which utilizes Machine Learining, API Integration, frontend and Backend development to create an interactive Webapp for
songs and playlist recommendations. Additionaly, a Tableau dashboard is embedded in the webapp is dockerised and a CI/CD pipeline has been setup as well. The Webapp is deployed on Amazon Web.
